# FNaF-ARchive

Head to [releases](https://github.com/Forsaken-Gaming/FNaF-ARchive/releases) to find preserved versions of ILLUMIX's now shut down Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery.
Details relating to each version are highlighted on their own release.
Every version has their own custom-made PlayFab server so that they can stay up for the forseeable future. 
These are meant to be snapshots of the game as they were when that version was current. For example: Version 1.0.0 only has the launch cast of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, Baby, and Springtrap.
